# Codeigniter-docker

basic files to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) as local environment for development with [Codeigniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/). My 2 cents here.

What we have here:

- A Dockerfile with the settings that codeigniter needs to work fine with [php](https://www.php.net/) environment.

- docker-compose.yml to turn it more easy to handle the container with start and stop cli commands

Just put in your root folder and be happy =D. Remember to erase thit _public_ folder here before start to use on your environment

## troubleshooting

Set permission on cache folder to work fine
